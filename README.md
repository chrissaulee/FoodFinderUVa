For our project milestone, we made the first few initial views, including a sign up screen, initial home screen, and a profile screen. We started with the design of the home screen, and we began the implementation of the camera, GPS, and device shake. The camera is beginning to be implemented to have a profile picture on the profile screen (I am not sure we got it to work yet), and the GPS/device shake is being implemented on the home screen.

Thanks! :)
